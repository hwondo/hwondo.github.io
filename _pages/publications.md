description: My mathematical research lies in the field of complex differential geometry. I am interested in Kahler geometry, a type of curved space that supports complex numbers and naturally appears in theoretical physics and algebraic geometry. I study such spaces by deforming them into simpler ones using geometric flows and related equations. This involves employing a wide range of tools from partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and metric geometry.
